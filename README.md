# **Zombie Barricade:**

## Story:

A recent virus mutation turned into a zombie outbreak! Your mission is to defend the last hope of humanity: The cure-zombie-destroyer-cool tower. Zombies are crashing into the barricades. Don't let them in!

Fully repair the broken tower of hope while getting rid of those pesky zombies. Do it on your own or with your friends!

## How to play:

Single player:

Get the tower fully repaired while repelling the zombies. You can use your tool to repair the tower and the barricades. Hit the barricade red button to trigger your spiky barricades against the zombies and win some extra points.

You may get the chance of getting a special weapon: The zombie killing shockwave! Detonate it when it appears on stage after killing some zombies.

You win if you fully repair the tower. You lose if zombies make their way through the barricades.

Multiplayer:

Cooperate or compete with your friend! Repair the tower, kill the zombies. Repair and kill more than your partner to win. Don't let the barricade on your side be destroyed or you will lose points.

The first one to detonate The zombie killing shockwave gets the points. Be faster than your mate!
